## Automatically detects Display Mode
RDAnalyzer was built to be as intuitive as possible. We automatically detect both the Display Mode as the current Active Encoder for your system.

## Real-time statistics
To further assist you with analyzing configuration settings we included real-time analytics on important statistics such as CPU time, Bandwidth and Network Latency.

## Change settings on the fly (pro edition)
Allow visually lossless compression, adjust color depth, video codec and frames per second.
